This is a collection of quick-ish reads that I've put together. It's my hope that these explain difficult or confusing topics in an easily digestible format. If you have an idea for something you'd like to see covered, please feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/dvirlar2/dvirlar-quarto-website/issues)!

The full list of available quick tips, hot tips, & tidbits (oh my) can be found below. Enjoy!
