    "text": "Project Introduction\nI attended the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara between 2018-2020 to get my Master’s in Environmental Science and Management, commonly referred to as a “MESM” degree among us Brennies. Although I was getting my Master’s, I wasn’t in a traditional program that focus on indepent research and writing a thesis at the end of your degree. Instead, the Bren masters programs focus on a thesis-like Group Project (GP) that students propose, select, and work through.\nWhile at Bren I specialized in two core areas: Conservation Planning and Environmental Economics & Policy. At the time, I was hoping to one day work to bridge the gap between conservation and policy at the State or Federal level, and was excited when a classmate approached me to be a co-author on a GP proposal with her. The proposal focused on determining conservation metrics for a newly established nature preserve, and providing policy recommendations for the client regarding the location and frequency of potential environmental education programs.\nThat proposal was ultimately one of twelve proposals selected out of nearly 40 project ideas by the GP Selection Committee. The client for the GP ended up being The Nature Conservancy, and my group lovingly dubbed ourselves the “DangerNERDS”. DangerNERDS is a blending of the word Dangermond (for the Dangermond Preserve) and the acronym NERDS, which stands for Nature, Education, Research, and Data Science.\n\n\nMy Role Within the Team\nFrom the get-go, I was the Internal Project Manager for my team. I organized, coordinated, and led weekly team meetings that were not client facing. Additionally, I established the direction our project would take for data collection and analysis. This included setting the stage for using a Multi-Criteria Analysis method to determine the potential ecological impact of each trail based upon different taxa. We ultimately chose a variety of indicator species across four groups: mammals, amphibians, raptors, and vegetation. Lastly, with the help of my co-project manager, I proofread all of our materials multiple times — including our 100+ page final report!\n\n\nProject Deliverables\nUltimately, all Bren MESMs must produce a poster, brief, final report, and website for their GPs. If you’d like to view any of those, or the proposal for the project, please click any of the buttons below.\n\nBrief Final Report Poster Proposal\n\n\n\nWhat I Learned\nAlthough my career goals are different today, I wouldn’t be where I am without the training and guidance from my peers and mentors at Bren, as well as this project specifically. I grew as a leader and project manager during undergrad through planning on campus events at CU Boulder, and I’m grateful I could continue that growth as the Internal Project Manager of my GP. Being at the helm also further instilled a sense of confidence that I could not only lead my peers in areas I was comfortable with, but also through uncharted waters (for us at least)."

Here, I help contribute to the open data science community by curating the metadata of submitted datasets. Generally, this is done by editing metadata documents using the Ecological Metadata Language (EML), which describes the who, what, where, when, why, and how of a dataset. By curating metadata, the Arctic Data Center helps ensure that data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by others.

If I’m not listening to music, you can bet I’m listening to a podcast! Below are a few of the ones I listen to regularly, they’re associated genre, and the show’s description from Spotify in case you’re unfamiliar with them.\n\nUp First – News.  NPR’s Up First is the news you need to start your day. The three biggest stories of the day, with reporting and analysis from NPR News — in 10 minutes.\nShort Wave – Educational.  New discoveries, everyday mysteries, and the science behind the headlines — all in about 10 minutes, every weekday. It’s science for everyone, using a lot of creativity and a little humor. Join host Emily Kwong for science on a different wavelength.\nLife Kit – Lifestyle.  Everyone needs a little help being a human. From sleep to saving money to parenting and more, we talk to the experts to get the best advice out there. Life Kit is here to help you get it together.\nOlogies – Educational & Comedy.  Volcanoes. Trees. Drunk butterflies. Mars missions. Slug sex. Death. Beauty standards. Anxiety busters. Beer science. Bee drama. Take away a pocket full of science knowledge and charming, bizarre stories about what fuels these professional -ologists’ obsessions. Humorist and science correspondent Alie Ward asks smart people stupid questions and the answers might change your life.\nMy Favorite Murder – True Crime & Comedy.  Lifelong fans of true crime stories Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark tell each other their favorite tales of murder and hear hometown crime stories from friends and fans.\nYour Own Backyard – True Crime.  A documentary podcast series investigating the 1996 disappearance of Cal Poly student, Kristin Smart.\n\n\n\nYouTube Favorites\nWhen I’m coding I usually need some sort of music playing in the background to help me focus. As such, I’ve found a couple of channels, playlists, and video categories that really help me dial in when I need to.\n\nLuna Ambience – Relaxing music from the “Breath of the Wild” video game\nNo Thoughts, Head Empty – A collection of videos with various (mostly fast-paced) Nintendo music to help you focus in Fast ModeTM . Don’t ask me how many times I’ve listened to Coconut Mall…\nDevAsLife – I enjoy listening to the ASMR-like coding videos on this channel, as well as “watching” them using the picture in picture method.\nStudy With Me – Many of these videos use the pomodoro technique and have soft music playing in the background. This is non-distracting for me, and has built-in breaks throughout the video. My absolute favorite is currently this “Write With Me” video from Ali Abdaal."

    "text": "One of the key tenets of programming is the DRY principle: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Essentially, this boils down to not repeating your code ad nauseum to change only one or two things. This is particularly useful for computationally intensive workflows that would require changing tens or hundreds of items. That’s where the for loop comes into play.\nFirst, let’s look at the basic syntax of a for loop. When you write one, you’re telling the computer “run this piece of code (statement) some number of times (range_of_values) in this spot (value).”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\n\nfor(value in range_of_values){\n  statement \n  print(statement) \n}\n\n\n\nAnd that’s it! Congratulations, now you know the syntax for a basic for loop! Now let’s see it in practice. Now let’s put it into practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nLet’s say Europe is experiencing a heat wave, but I’m not quite grasping the context of how bad it is because I’m not familiar with the Celsius temperature scale. I know the average temperatures are somewhere between 35-40°C, so I’ll write a quick function to convert the temperatures into Fahrenheit! But that spans over five numbers, and writing that function out five individual times goes against the DRY principle. This gives us the perfect excuse to write a for loop.\nThe equation for converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the following. \\[(deg C*1.8) + 32\\] Knowing that conversion formula, here’s how I’d write my for loop:\n\nfor(degC in 35:40){\n  # Write your statement. Make sure the output of the statement is assigned to an object,\n  # otherwise R will only remember the very last conversion value. \n  fahr <- (degC*1.8) + 32\n  \n  # Print the outputs\n  print(fahr)\n}\n\n[1] 95\n[1] 96.8\n[1] 98.6\n[1] 100.4\n[1] 102.2\n[1] 104\n\n\nYep, that’s pretty toasty!\n\n\nFor more help on for loops and other iterative processes, make sure to check out the R for Data Science book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund!"
