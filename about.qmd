### YouTube Favorites

When I'm coding I usually need some sort of music playing in the background to help me focus. As such, I've found a couple of channels, playlists, and video categories that really help me dial in when I need to.

-   [Luna Ambience](https://www.youtube.com/c/LunaAmbience) -- Relaxing music from the "Breath of the Wild" video game
-   [No Thoughts, Head Empty](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa0x7DaDYP_uEKCqAkbCZvqPq-d5069mZ) -- A collection of videos with various (mostly fast-paced) Nintendo music to help you focus in Fast Mode^TM^ . Don't ask me how many times I've listened to Coconut Mall...
-   [DevAsLife](https://www.youtube.com/c/devaslife) -- I enjoy listening to the ASMR-like coding videos on this channel, as well as "watching" them using the picture in picture method.
-   [Study With Me](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=study+with+me) -- Many of these videos use the pomodoro technique and have soft music playing in the background. This is non-distracting for me, and has built-in breaks throughout the video. My absolute favorite is currently this *"[Write With Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTH824WnA3U&t=435s)"* video from Ali Abdaal.
