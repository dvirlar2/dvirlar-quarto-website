## Welcome!

I’m an early career interdisciplinary data scientist with experience in academia, consulting, and non-profits. Over the past five years, I’ve dabbled in spatial data analysis, environmental policy work, data and metadata archival, and project management for research teams. In general, I’m excited about using my knowledge to further data management and reproducibility best practices on teams, perform analyses on unique datasets, and working collaboratively to solve interdisciplinary problems. 

In my spare time, you can find me somewhere with my dog Moose, gaming on my 
Nintendo Switch, or listening to my favorite podcasts! <!---You can read more about more about me and my work experience on my [about page](about.qmd). --->
