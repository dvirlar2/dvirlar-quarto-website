## Welcome!

I'm an early career data scientist working at the [Arctic Data
Center](arcticdata.io), a data repository funded through the National
Science Foundation, as the lead Projects Data Coordinator. Here, I help
contribute to the open data science community by curating the metadata
of submitted datasets. Generally, this is done by editing metadata
documents using the [Ecological Metadata
Language](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/) (EML), which describes the
*who, what, where, when, why, and how* of a dataset. By curating
metadata, the Arctic Data Center helps ensure that data are findable,
accessible, interoperable, and reusable by others.

In my spare time you can find me somewhere with my dog Moose, playing my 
Nintendo Switch, or listening to my favorite podcasts! You can find out more 
about me [here](about.qmd).
